# Lifting State Up

Created a small example of how `Lifting State Up` concept can be achieved in react.

- App component is a parent component and child component is a child of App component.
- Created a state variable `counter` in App component.
- Passed a state function from parent i.e. App Component to child component, which will cause parent component to rerender again from child component actions.
